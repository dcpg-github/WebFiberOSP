# WebFiberOSP
An attempt at a web based fiber OSP mapper

My plan for this is to start with Leaflet, add a few controls around it for the various fiber OSP layers, and see if I can come up with something workable.  

I had some notes somewhere, I'll add them in here, or as a separate file.  
They're in the notebook in my backpack.  

I intend for a portion of any revenue this generates to support the projects that made this possible.

This map kind of does what we want - it allows you to draw on the map object.  Note it's using mapbox though, not leaflet.
