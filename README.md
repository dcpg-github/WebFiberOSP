# WebFiberOSP
An attempt at a web based fiber OSP mapper

My plan for this is to start with Leaflet, add a few controls around it for the various fiber OSP layers, and see if I can come up with something workable.  

I had some notes somewhere, I'll add them in here, or as a separate file.  

# https://leafletjs.com/download.html  
This project uses Leaflet for all visualization.   
I intend for a portion of any revenue this generates to go to Leaflet.  

# https://geojson.org/  
This project uses the GeoJSON format for data storage.  

(plans)  
# https://jquery.com/download/  
This project uses jQuery to ease any back end functions.  

(plans)  
# https://getbootstrap.com/  
This project uses Bootstrap to attempt to be not ugly.
